    public static let noSavedSettings           = ImGuiWindowFlags(rawValue: 1 << 8)  // Never load/save settings in .ini file
    public static let noMouseInputs             = ImGuiWindowFlags(rawValue: 1 << 9)  // Disable catching mouse or keyboard inputs

You may use SetNextWindowContentSize(ImVec2(width,0.0f)); prior to calling Begin() to specify width. Read code in imgui_demo in the "Horizontal Scrolling" section.

    public static let unsavedDocument           = ImGuiWindowFlags(rawValue: 1 << 20) // Append '*' to title without affecting the ID, as a convenience to avoid using the ### operator. When used in a tab/docking context, tab is selected on closure and closure is deferred by one frame to allow code to cancel the closure (with a confirmation popup, etc.) without flicker.
    public static let noDocking                 = ImGuiWindowFlags(rawValue: 1 << 21) // Disable docking of this window
